    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how user information is handled while using our spreadsheet tools and associated services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining transparency about how your data is accessed and used. This tool operates primarily using Google Apps Script and Google Sheets, which means it runs entirely on Google’s secure infrastructure. No user data is ever stored or logged by us outside of Google’s ecosystem. Any optional data submitted by users (such as feedback or bug reports) is treated with the highest confidentiality and deleted after use.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our main spreadsheet tool does not collect or store any personal information. It runs through Google Apps Script, meaning all functionality is executed on your device or Google’s servers without sending any data to external databases. If you choose to use a feedback or bug report form, we may collect basic information such as your name or email to respond appropriately. This data is completely optional and only gathered if you decide to provide it. We do not track, monitor, or log your activity while using the spreadsheet.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>We do not access, store, or analyze any of your personal spreadsheet content. Any data you submit through optional forms (like bug reports) is solely used to improve our tools or provide support. Once an issue is resolved, we delete the related data permanently and do not retain any history. We believe in minimal data handling and operate on a zero-retention policy unless absolutely necessary for functionality. The core tool itself functions independently without any user tracking or analytics. Any submitted information (such as bug reports) is deleted after it has served its purpose.</p>

    <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
    <p>This spreadsheet tool does not use cookies directly. However, if you are accessing it through a web-based interface like Google Sheets or GitHub Pages, your browser or platform may use cookies. These cookies are managed by Google or GitHub and not controlled by us. You can manage or disable cookies in your browser settings at any time. We recommend checking your browser’s help resources for more on managing cookies specific to your setup.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or trade any user data with third parties. All spreadsheet logic and features are handled through Apps Script, which does not include third-party tracking or data pipelines. Any form-submitted data is used solely for support and never sent to outside services. We do not monetize or analyze any user behavior or content within the spreadsheet. Your data remains yours, fully private and secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your Google account and any files connected to the spreadsheet. You can revoke access, delete files, or disconnect the tool from your account at any time via Google’s security settings. Since we do not collect or store data, there is no user profile or database to modify or delete. If you contact us with personal data, you may request deletion of that information and we will comply promptly. We always respect user decisions regarding privacy and consent.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>All data processing is done within Google’s secure infrastructure. We do not host or transmit your information across third-party services. Our use of Apps Script ensures that only you can view or manipulate your data unless you explicitly share it. Security permissions are determined by your Google account settings, and you can manage them at any time. We recommend reviewing your account’s app permissions to stay informed about what you’ve authorized.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about your data or how the tool functions, please feel free to reach out. We are happy to provide clarification and support where needed. You can email us at <strong>thespyrostudios@gmail.com</strong> or <strong>theskylandeer@gmail.com</strong>, and we will do our best to respond quickly. Our goal is to create tools that are safe, transparent, and respectful of your privacy. Thank you for trusting us with your Skylanders collection journey.</p>
